# INTECHFEST 2025 CTF
An annual, national level CTF competition hosted by Polikteknik Negeri Bali (PNB). 

## **Author's Note:**

For this Write Up specifically, we only made the ones for the web exploitation and reverse engineering challenges. We did solve other challenges from cryptography but it will definitely takee a lot of time to write due to its complexity. 

To save time and since we have another upcoming CTF (at the time of writing this), we decided only two include challenges from these two categories since they are the most interesting!!!
