## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: What exactly is a CTF?**

A: **CTF** stands for **Capture The Flag**. It's a type of cybersecurity competition where participants solve a series of challenges to find hidden pieces of text, known as "flags." Submitting a flag proves you have successfully completed a challenge and earns you points. It's like a digital scavenger hunt for hackers, designed to test a wide range of security skills.

**Q: What are the common types of CTF challenges?**

A: Challenges are typically grouped into several categories. The most common ones you'll see are:
- **Web Exploitation:** Finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications (e.g., SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting).
- **Cryptography:** Breaking or decrypting ciphers and codes to reveal the hidden message or flag.
- **Reverse Engineering:** Analyzing a compiled program (an executable) to understand its functionality without having the source code.
- **Binary Exploitation (Pwn):** Finding vulnerabilities in a program's binary code and exploiting them to gain control of the system.
- **Digital Forensics:** Investigating and analyzing digital artifacts, like disk images or network traffic captures, to find clues or hidden data.
- **OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence):** Gathering information from publicly available sources to find the flag.

**Q: How do CTFs relate to real-world cybersecurity?**

A: CTFs are a powerful training ground. They provide a safe, legal, and controlled environment to practice and hone the exact skills used by cybersecurity professionals. The challenges are often based on real-world vulnerabilities and scenarios, making them an excellent way to build practical, hands-on experience in both offensive and defensive security.

**Q: How can I get started with CTFs?**

A: The best way to start is by trying! There are many platforms designed for beginners.
- **Practice Platforms:** Check out [PicoCTF](https://picoctf.org/), [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/), and [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.com/).
- **Read Write-ups:** Reading solutions from other competitions (like the ones in this repository!) is a fantastic way to learn new techniques.
- **Join a Community:** Find a team or a local cybersecurity group. Learning with others is much more effective and fun!
- **Keep Playing:** Keep improving your skills by continously joining CTFs. It does not matter whether you lose or not, it's about the new things you learn from it. 
- **Never give up!**
